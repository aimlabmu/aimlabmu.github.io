          <p>AIM Solution is a research team composing of Assoc.Prof. Panrasee Ritthipravat and her graduated students from Department of Biomedical Engineering, Mahidol University. Our team has continually conducted research on robot assisted therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders for more than 5 years. Robot assisted communication training is one of the robots developed under this project. It is the sixth version and it aims to be used as assistive tool for teachers, caregivers, parents, and therapists in order to create communication training session for children with autism spectrum disorders at schools, households, and hospitals. The robot makes learning more fun, interactive, and enhances children engagement in the training. It is suitable for children with the age of 5 to 12 years old. More than 100 teaching contents have been developed and tested in five schools and a hospital. Users can freely download these contents from a content sharing platform. Moreover, we developed a robot control program that allows user to simply create teaching contents. The contents can be designed and created to fit with individual needs. Efficient training sessions thus can be set up as frequently as possible and truly fit with each child.</p>
